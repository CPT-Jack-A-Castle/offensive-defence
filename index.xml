      <description>Ryan Cobb has just tagged the release of SharpSploit v1.6, which comes with a number of cool changes. The most significant of which includes some very clever Dynamic Invocation functionality that TheWover has blogged about. My contributions were relatively minor and will be the subject of this post.

      <description>So welcome along to our joint blog with @_RastaMouse @Rythmstick and @Furby, I&amp;rsquo;m @CyberZombi3 we hope to blog about all levels of Red Team and Blue teaming, our combined skillsets, areas of expertise and desire to gain knowledge from one another should provide a little something for everyone so with that said this is my first blog here, which can also can be found at cyberzombi3.co.uk
I usually blog in the style of a basic guide, for this blog though I wanted to throw out a few suggestions around Offensive Defence (very apt donâ€™t you think) Think how an attacker starts their mission, with some recon right.</description>
